### Features
• Invokes the Internet Univision API (http://developer.univision.com/)
• Demonstrates how to add XML feeds to C#
• Provides a baseline for a Windows 8 Store App

### Requirements
• Windows 8
• Visual Studio 2012 Express for Windows 8 or higher


### Setup
• Download the Starter Kit Zip Portfolio from  http://apimash.github.io/StarterKits/ 
• Open the Solution in Visual Studio
• Compile and Run

### Customization

Step 1. Add your Developer Key in the Globals.cs source file on line 20

Step 2. Global.cs provides URI's for 2 of the Univision sites. 

 - **UNIVISION CHANNEL ENTERTAINMENT** - Search in the entertainment channel.    
 - **UNIVISION CHANNEL NOTICIAS** - Search in the news channel.
     
Each site returns the same XML payload format. The Starter Kit can be customized to display results from any of these sites. I encourage you to experiment  by simple changing the site selection in the ItemsPage.xaml.cs file on line 82, to include any channel that you want to define in Globals.cs


Step 3. You can modify the parameters to each query such as the limit of the number of articles to return in total per channel. Experiment by changing the ‘sites’ parameter on the ‘default query’ call on line 24 of Globals.cs. Visit the API [link text][2] to experiment on line.

Step 4. Gossip information is EXTREMELY  mashable! Experiment by combining Univision's API with Bing showing more information about the user's searches.
