### Requirements

 - Windows 8
 - Visual Studio 2012 Express for Windows 8 or higher

### Setup

 - Download the Starter Kit Zip Portfolio from (http://apimash.github.io/StarterKits/)
 - Open the Solution in Visual Studio
 - Compile and Run

### Customization

Step 1. All of the Blizzard World of Warcraft API's do not require a developer key to use.  However, if you plan on creating an application with heavy api usage Blizzard requests you contact them at api-support@blizzard.com to register your application.

Step 2. Currently only Realm Status is implemented.  Adding additional functionality such as character or pvp info is as easy as calling the appropriate wow api (found in http://blizzard.github.io/api-wow-docs/) and then wrapping it in a function the same way realm status was done in /js/wowapi.js.

Step 3. Once you have data returning you should bind to a listview in the same manner /realmstatus/realmstatus.js currently is.  

Step 4. It is highly recommend you use WinJS page controls to follow standard convention.  Simply create a new folder in the root of the project, right click and add a new "Page Control".  Then edit the html, css, and js in the same manner that was done in the /realmstatus page control.
