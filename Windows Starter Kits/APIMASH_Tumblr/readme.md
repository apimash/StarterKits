### Features
 - Invokes the Tumblr API (http://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/api/v2), specifically the tags endpoint
 - Demonstrates how to download an image to the pictures directory
 - Demonstrates how to write a file to the local application directory ( cacheing of data)
 - Provides a baseline for a Windows 8 Store App
 - Sample result call can be seen in the browser via this url http://api.tumblr.com/v2/tagged?tag=gif&api_key=[YOUR_APP_KEY]

### Requirements

 - Windows 8
 - Visual Studio 2012 Express for Windows 8 or higher
 - Tumblr API Developer key (http://www.tumblr.com/oauth/apps ) 
 - Utilizes jQuery version 2.0.0 (http://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.0.0.js)

### Setup

 - Download the Starter Kit Zip Portfolio from http://apimash.github.io/StarterKits/
 - Open the Solution in Visual Studio
 - Compile and Run
 **NOTE**: You will need to add your own developer signing certificate to the project, by opening the package.appxmanifest file, and switching to the Packaging tab. On the packaging tab, click the "Choose Certificate..." button, and in the resulting dialog, click the "Configure Certificate..." drop-down, and select "Create test certificate..." then click OK to dismiss all dialogs, and save the app manifest file.

### Customization
What is being searched for from the Tumblr api can be changed. In this example, "lol" and "gifs" are being searched for. Two ways exist to change
these parameters.
- Modify the developer key, which you will need to get from Tumblr.(http://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/api/v2)
- Modify the __tags array in the apimashtumblr.js and put in the items you want to search for
- Modify the call to get the data in tumblr.js to pass an array of tags you would like to search for
- The UI and overall experience can easily be changed by writing your own view logic in tumblr.js - replacing what is there. 

### Future Features
 - Include OAuth and OAuth related endpoints
