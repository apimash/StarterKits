### Description
The Facebook Starter Kit is a XAML/C# Windows 8 app that leverages the Chuck Norris Starter Kit.  The Chuck Norris Starter Kit
demonstrates calling a Web Service that returned a simple JSON payload. The JSON payload is deserialized into a View Model.
We use the Facebook .NET SDK (http://facebooksdk.net) to customize the API call to the Chuck Norris database based on of Friend's
names and post the jokes to our Facebook feed.
