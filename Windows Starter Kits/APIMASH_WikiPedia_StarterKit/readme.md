 - wikipediaSearch - Search for a place name and optionally text from the title of the article
 - wikipediaBoundingBox - Search for entries within a south, north, east, and west latitude and longitude bounded box
 - User name is stored in isolated storage between sessions.  No editing .cs or .js files to get it to run
