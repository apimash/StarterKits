----------
### Description
The TomTom Starter Kit is a XAML/C# Windows Phone 8 map-based application that overlays locations of traffic cameras across the US and Canada as provided by [TomTom][1].  The application has been built to easily display geocoded points-of-interest obtained from other APIs.

### Features
 - Invokes the [TomTom Traffic Cameras API][2]
 - Demonstrates how to deserialize XML to C#
 - Provides a baseline for a Windows Phone 8 App

### Requirements

 - Windows 8 (64-bit Professional version or higher)
 - [Visual Studio 2012 Express for Windows Phone][3] or higher
 - [Mashery ID to access TomTom Developer Portal][4] and obtain API license key

### Setup

 - Download the [Starter Kit Zip Portfolio][5] 
 - Navigate to the **APIMASH\_TomTom\_StarterKit\_Phone** directory and open the solution there
 - Paste your TomTom Traffic Cam API key into designated portion of the **App.xaml** file

### Customization
This starter kit was built in a modular manner to make it easy to integrate just about any API that has elements exposing latitude and longitude. The map implementation already includes necessary 
logic for showing point-of-interest pins and marking your current location as determined by GPS.

The code includes "TODO" markers in the files to highlight what needs to be modified to accommodate a different geoencoded API as well as optional steps that can be used to further customize the application.  

Minimally, you'll need to do two things:

 1. Implement an API wrapper class for your chosen data provider (using the **APIMASH_TomTom.cs** code as a model)
 2. Modify **MainPage.xaml** and its code-behind to data bind to your API's view model, adapting the layout to show the details of the point-of-interest selected on the map.
