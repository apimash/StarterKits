### Setup

 - Download the Starter Kit Zip Portfolio from (http://apimash.github.io/StarterKits/)
 - Open the Solution in Visual Studio
 - Compile and Run

### Customization

Step 1. All of the Blizzard World of Warcraft API's do not require a developer key to use.  However, if you plan on creating an application with heavy api usage Blizzard requests you contact them at api-support@blizzard.com to register your application.

Step 2. Currently only Realm Status is implemented.  Adding additional functionality such as character or pvp info is as easy as calling the appropriate wow api (found in http://blizzard.github.io/api-wow-docs/) and then wrapping it in a function the same way realm status was done in /js/wowapi.js.

Step 3. Once you have data returning you should load the results into a Web Browser Control using divs similar to /html/index.html.
